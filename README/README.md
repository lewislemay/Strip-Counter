## __Colour Strip Counter__
### __Project Description__
__*Scope and Functionality*__ - *Colour Strip Counter* is used to quickly add the colour strips counted, provide the amount of full sets you have, and provide the number of extra colour strips you have that do not make a full set.

The user will first be asked for 2 inputs:
1. The totals of each pile of colour strips they counted (with each amount being separated by a comma)
2. How many individual strips are required to make a full set

The program will then output the total amount of strips that were counted, how many complete sets that makes, and the amount of extra strips left over.\
Finally, the program will ask the user if they would like to count another set.

__*Motivation*__ - Allows me to demonstrate and test my knowledge of JavaScript by applying the concepts learned through my program at UofA.
