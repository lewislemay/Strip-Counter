# University of Alberta Browser Console Template Repository
## Full Stack Web Application Development Program
### This repository is intended for the development of console JavaScript applications.

Run `npm run lint` to attempt to detect errors in your repository.

Use `output()` and `await input()` from `./src/js/scripts.js` to allow the user to interact with the console.
To run the console, launch `./src/index.html`.


## __Mock Login System__
### __Project Description__
__*Scope and Functionality*__ - This Mock Login System can be used to model real-world scenarios related to logging into or registering for a program.

The user will be prompted to select either "Register", "Login", or "Quit".
1. If "Register" is selected, the user will go through the process of choosing a unique username and a password over 8 characters long. Once successfully registered, their username and password will be stored in a dictionary for the rest of the session.
2. If "Login" is selected, the user will be asked to enter a username and password that has already been defined in the dictionary. If both username and password entered are identical to what is stored in the dictionary, the login attempt is considered successful.
3. If "Quit" is selected, the program will display a goodbye message and end the session.

__*Motivation*__ - Allows me to demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript using arrays, dictionaries, sets, and functions.
